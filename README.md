### Data Visualization Projects - Visualize Data with a Bar Chart
Dataset link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json <br/>
**d3 js library v4 is used**
###### Sample user stories:
* My chart should have a title with a corresponding id="title"
* My chart should have a g element x-axis with a corresponding id="x-axis"
* The data-xvalue and data-yvalue of each dot should be within the range of the actual data and in the correct data format. For data-xvalue, integers (full years) or Date objects are acceptable for test evaluation. For data-yvalue (minutes), use Date objects.
* Both axes should contain multiple tick labels, each with the corresponding class="tick"
* I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.
* I can see multiple tick labels on the y-axis with %M:%S time format.<br/>
